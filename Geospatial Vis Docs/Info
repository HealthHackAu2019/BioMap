Geospatial Visualisation resources from Paulina:
Let me know if the html files work (theyâ€™re my markdown files)

I would use ggmap â€“ which is the map version of ggplot â€“ and you can layer things onto the one map.

Let me know if you need any help (Iâ€™m in the cannabis group) ðŸ˜Š

Kind regards,
Paulie
